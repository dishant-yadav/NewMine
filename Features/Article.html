        A team of palaeontologists has discovered a new early skeleton that is
        so far, the oldest dinosaur skeleton ever found in Africa. It is
        estimated <em>Mbiresaurus raathi</em> was a long-necked dinosaur that
        was about 6 feet long, weighing between 10 and 30 kilograms. A graduate
        student at Virginia Tech discovered the mostly intact fossil in Northern
        Zimbabwe and it was unearthed over two digs in 2017 and 2019.

          in August. The skeleton is only missing some of the dinosaur’s hands
          and portions of the skull. The international team who were part of the
          research includes palaeontologists from the National Museums and
          Monuments of Zimbabwe, the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe, and
          Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

          “The discovery of <em>Mbiresaurus raathi</em> fills in a critical
          geographic gap in the fossil record of the oldest dinosaurs and shows
          the power of hypothesis-driven fieldwork for testing predictions about
          the ancient past. These are Africa’s oldest-known definitive
          dinosaurs, roughly equivalent in age to the oldest dinosaurs found
          anywhere in the world. The oldest known dinosaurs — from roughly 230
          million years ago, the Carnian Stage of the Late Triassic period — are
          extremely rare and have been recovered from only a few places
          worldwide, mainly northern Argentina, southern Brazil, and India.”
          said Christopher Griffin, who discovered the fossil, in a press
          statement.

          The researchers’ findings suggest that <em>Mbiresaurus</em> stood on
          two legs and had a head that was small in comparison to those legs,
          like many of its dinosaur relatives. The dinosaur had small
          triangle-shaped teeth that were serrated, which suggests that it could
          have been a herbivore or an omnivore.

          “We never expected to find such a complete and well-preserved dinosaur
          skeleton. When I found the femur of <em>Mbiresaurus</em>, I
          immediately recognized it as belonging to a dinosaur and I knew I was
          holding the oldest dinosaur ever found in Africa. When I kept digging
          and found the left hip bone right next to the left thigh bone, I had
          to stop and take a breath — I knew that a lot of the skeleton was
          probably there, still articulated together in life position,” added
          Griffin.
